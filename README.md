## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** LLVM/Clang 15+ or GCC 11+

### Get Started in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/c-from-the-ground-up.git
cd c-from-the-ground-up

# 2. Navigate to first lesson
cd Part1_Core_Concepts/01_HelloWorld

# 3. Compile and run your first program
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o hello_world 1_hello_world.c
./hello_world
```

The curriculum is designed to be self-contained with each lesson building upon previous concepts.

## Course Philosophy

### Code-First Learning

Every concept is taught directly within working C programs. No separate textbooks or theory-heavy explanations - the code itself contains comprehensive comments explaining every detail.

### Progressive Complexity

Start with `printf("Hello, World!");` and end with a complete text adventure game using ncurses, file I/O, and advanced data structures.

### Real-World Skills

Build actual tools and applications that solve real problems, creating a portfolio of work that demonstrates practical C programming abilities.

### Memory Safety Focus

Learn secure C development practices from day one, understanding how to prevent common vulnerabilities while leveraging C's power.
